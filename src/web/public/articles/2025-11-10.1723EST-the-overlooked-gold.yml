    In today's AI gold rush, startups are scrambling to hire "AI talent."
    But too often, they're chasing buzzwords, not understanding them — and in the process, they overlook the people who actually know what they're doing.

    The irony is painful: companies desperate for technical leadership end up passing on candidates who could have defined their AI strategy, simply because they don't "speak the new hype."

    ## 1. The "Overqualified" Fallacy

    Founders and recruiters still fear the overqualified label. They see résumés with 8+ years in applied machine learning, robotics, NLP, or reinforcement learning — and assume that person won't "fit" a lean startup.

    They're wrong.

    Those candidates often want exactly what early-stage environments offer:
    autonomy, experimentation, and the freedom to build something real without layers of red tape.

    When a candidate who's worked on real-world inference systems or embedded AI models applies, that's not a mismatch — that's a shortcut to technical maturity.
    You're getting someone who's already survived the growing pains you haven't hit yet.

    ## 2. The LLM/GenAI Bias

    One of the most unfortunate trends in modern hiring is the LLM tunnel vision.
    Employers often conflate "AI experience" with "hands-on with ChatGPT APIs,"
    and dismiss years of applied AI, signal processing, or computer vision as outdated.

    Someone who's spent a decade designing custom architectures, deploying edge AI in constrained systems, or red-teaming adversarial models might get told they "lack GenAI exposure." Meanwhile, a newcomer with no degree but a strong sales pitch in "prompt engineering" lands the job.

    That's not innovation — that's amnesia.

    This disparity between experts and what employers think they want erodes trust.
    It makes true experts feel like they're being lied to — like their experience is suddenly invisible because the language changed faster than the science.

    ## 3. The Cost of Confusing Hype with Competence

    Every wave of hype in tech has its opportunists, but AI is uniquely vulnerable.
    When hiring becomes a game of buzzword bingo — "RAG," "GenAI," "AGI-ready," —
    companies end up with impressive slide decks and shallow systems.

    What they don't realize is that foundational AI expertise is what allows startups to scale beyond the APIs.

    If no one in the company understands model architecture, dataset bias, or fine-tuning constraints, you're not building AI — you're renting it.

    ## 4. What Founders Should Rethink

    - **Depth matters more than recency.** Someone who understands AI's core principles can pick up any new framework in days. Someone who memorizes prompts without that foundation will struggle to adapt when the APIs change.

    - **Don't confuse communication skill with comprehension.** Some of the best AI engineers are understated. Some of the loudest "AI experts" can't explain a loss function.

    - **Invest in translation, not hype.** Hire someone who can bridge between research and product — not just echo the latest OpenAI blog post.

    - **Recognize that AI talent isn't linear.** A single true expert can de-risk your roadmap more than ten surface-level hires.

    ## 5. The Real Deal

    The startups that win this decade won't be the ones that sound the most AI-native —
    they'll be the ones that actually understand what AI is and who knows how to wield it.

    If you're lucky enough to find someone who's lived through multiple AI waves — pre-LLM, pre-transformer, pre-hype — don't dismiss them as "overqualified."
    They've seen what happens when industries overpromise and underbuild.

    That kind of scar tissue is invaluable.

    In the rush to ride the next AI wave, don't forget the people who built the ocean.
